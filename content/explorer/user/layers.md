You can control what layers are overlaid on the globe's terrain, allowing you to
customize your view of the earth. Layers can be maps, imagery, markers, symbology 
and controls, or customized renderable content.

## Layer List
The Layer List allows you to control which layers are visible and the order in 
which the layers are drawn on the globe. Layers are categorized such that 
standardized rules can be applied to groups of layers.

- Click _Layers_ in the main menu to show or hide the layer list.


### Layer Categories
#### Base Maps

#### Overlays

#### Datasets

#### Effects

#### Widgets

### Layer Ordering
Layers categories are drawn in the following order: base map layer(s), followed by overlays and 
finally the data sets (markers, shapes, etc). Effects and widgets are drawn
with their own rules. You can control the order in which base maps and overlays
are drawn.
