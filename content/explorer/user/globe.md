### Navigation
You can pan, rotate and tilt the globe and zoom in/out using the mouse, touch screen and keyboard.

#### Mouse/Touch Controls
- __Zoom__ with your mouse wheel (pinch gesture for mobile devices).
- __Pan__ the globe by dragging the mouse or your finger. 
- __Tilt__ the globe by dragging the right mouse button or your two fingers upward/downward.
- __Rotate__ the globe by dragging the right mouse button or your two fingers left/right.

#### View Controls
- A set of view controls overlaid on the globe allow zoom, rotate, tilt, and vertical exaggeration.

#### Keyboard Controls
The keyboard may provide more precise or granular control than the mouse or touch screen.  

- __Panning__: use the _up_, _down_, _left_, _right_ arrow key
- __Zooming__: use the _+_ and _-_ minus keys to zoom
- Holding a key down will repeat at a progressively faster rate

Note: The _focus_ must be on the globe for the keyboard controls to work. If the 
keyboard controls are not working, just click on the globe to set the focus and 
your subsequent keystrokes will be sent to the globe navigator.
