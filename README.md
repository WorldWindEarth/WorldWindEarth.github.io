# WorldWind Explorer
The [__Explorer__](https://worldwind.earth/explorer) is an HTML5/JavaScript geo-browser 
_[powered by WorldWindJS](https://emxsys.github.io/worldwindjs/)_ and the Knockout and Bootstrap libraries. 
It is implemented as a single-page web application (SPA) using JQuery to dynamically load content.

## Overview
The _WorldWind Explorer_ is a geospatial web application for visualizing Earth. It uses the
WorldWindJS library (forked from the NASA WebWorldWind SDK) to display a 3D globe with terrain 
and imagery as well as 2D maps. It displays the sunrise and sunset times and solar angles
for any point on the earth. It shows the terrain's aspect and slope for any 
location. It features user-defined markers and point weather forecasts.
It has a search feature to find places.
